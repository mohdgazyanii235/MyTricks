# MyTricks

This is a repo for all the cool stuff I do and all the pentesting related programs I make.


### Untar is a little bash program I wrote to make the process of unzipping tar files. The actual tar utility in Kali is obnoxiously convuluted (not to say it isn't powerful) but this program will be used for 90% of my tasks!
